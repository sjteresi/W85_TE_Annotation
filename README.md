# Introduction:
This repository contains the documentation and scripts necessary for generating a TE annotation and TE presence analysis for a diploid blueberry genome as part of a collaborative project with researchers from NC State. I used the  [EDTA](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA) by Shujun Ou to generate my TE annotations. EDTA installation directions can be found on that repository's main page.

# Materials and Methods:
[EDTA](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA) version 1.9.7 was used to annotate and characterize the TEs in the genome. The EDTA pipeline utilized the `Vce1.0.fasta` FASTA file and `vcae1.4.cds.fa` CDS FASTA file as primary inputs to `EDTA.pl`. Default options were used in all cases except for the usage of the `--cds`, `--sensitive 1`, and `--anno` options. The `--sensitive 1` option tells the program to use RepeatModeler to identify remaining TEs that were missed by structure-based methods following the normal progression of the pipeline. Version controlled documentation and all code related to recreating the analysis is located in the following [https://github.com/sjteresi/W85_TE_Annotation](https://github.com/sjteresi/W85_TE_Annotation) GitHub repository. The script for recreating the analysis can be found within the file `src/Annotate_W85_TEs_EDTA.sb` and the complete list of package versions can be found within the `doc/requirements.txt` and `doc/conda_list.log` files.
