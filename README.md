# W85 Annotation
This repository stores all of my work relating to the TE annotation of W85, a diploid blueberry genome.

# Installation:
I prefer to use [EDTA](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA) by Shujun Ou to generate my TE annotations. EDTA installation directions can be found there.

# Usage:
Scripts can be be found in the `src/` directory.
